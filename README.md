# Drills

A trivial question-and-answer drill. Could be for anything,
here the content of the data.dart file is a set of drills of
the latin verb 'sum'

A state machine with a grand total of two states and perhaps
a hundred lines of code. No doubt it could have been done in
much less. Written in Dart. Dart is splendid.
